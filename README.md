# To-Do
* Stop creeps from crowding sources[0]!!!!!!
  * Need to implement some sort of sourceFinder in the event that the closest source is crowded, go to the next closest within a reasonable range from the spawn (<20?)
* Create spawn queue
* Fine tune roles to optimize their efforts
* Create new roles as needed
* Let upgraders and builders prefer energy from spawn if spawn has energy greater than 50% capacity.
* Refactor parts of scripts for efficiency
* Learn what else you can do in this game...

## Done
* Automatically spawn new creeps to replace dying ones.
* Refactored roles into castes/jobs
* Fixed workspace to use grunt-screeps
